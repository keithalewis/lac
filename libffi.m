_Platform_ refers to the chip architecture and operating system.

The signature, or C InterFace, of a function consists of its return type and
required argument types. The `ffi_cif` struct contains this information
and additional platform specific information.

Types are described by a `ffi_type` struct. It consists of the size of the
type, its platform specific alignment, a type identifier, and an array
of pointers to other `ffi_type`s if it is a struct or union.

The `ffi_cif` must be prepared to set platform specific information.  The function
`ffi_status ffi_prep_cif(ffi_cif *cif, ffi_abi abi, unsigned int nargs, ffi_type *rtype, ffi_type **argtypes)
populates `cif` with the required information to call a C function.

Use `abi = FFI_DEFAULT_ABI` for standard C functions.

A C function can be called with a pointer to its symbol and the addresses of its required
arguments. A pointer to memory with sufficient space to accomodate
the return value must also be provided.

The function `void ffi_call(ffi_cif *cif, void *fn, void *rvalue, void
**avalues)` uses the prepared `cif` to arrange `avalues` on the call
stack, call `fn`, and deposit the result into the memory pointed to by
`rvalue`. It knows nothing about memory allocation and requires the user
to make all necessary arrangements to ensure the memory being
pointed to exists.

There is a minium size for return values. They are widened to the register size of the platform.
The type `ffi_arg` is large enough to hold them. There is no minimum size for arguments.

The cif for variadic functions must be prepared with both the the fixed and variable arguments.
`ffi_status ffi_prep_cif_var(ffi_cif *cif, ffi_abi abi,
unsigned int nfixedargs, unsigned int ntotalargs, ffi_type *rtype, ffi_type **argtypes)`

It can then be used in `ffi_call` with `ntotalargs` in `avalues`.







A union is a struct with one element having maximum size and alignment.
